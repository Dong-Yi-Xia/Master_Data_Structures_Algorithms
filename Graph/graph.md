# Graph

In graph each node or vertex (circle) is connected with edge (line).  
Great for things connect to other things

linked list is a type of tree, tree is a type of graph

## Directed and Undirected 
- directed is one way  direction
- undirected is any direction

## Weighted and Unweighted
- unweighted, data only in the nodes
- weighted, data are in both the nodes and edges (google map fastest path)

## Cyclic and Acyclic 
- cyclic - the first point is connected to the last point forming a loop
- acyclic - no loop


// Edge List  
// Adjacent List  
// Adjacent Matrix  

Pro
- relationship

con
- scaling is hard
