- arrays
- stacks
- queues
- linked lists
- tree
- tries
- graph
- hash tables

## Algorithms

Data Structure is a collection of data, how they are organized and stored.  
Algorithms are the logic using the data.  
Data Structure + Algorithms = Program  

CPU (Central Processing Unit) -   
RAM (Random Access Memory)- Temporary variable (Fast)  
Storage - Persisent/Permanent Data (Slow)  

8 Bits = 1 Byte
