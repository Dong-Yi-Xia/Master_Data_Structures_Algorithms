# Recursion

Searching and sorting   
Subtask - same task over and over

Stack overflow - keep calling itself forever

stacks - need to store memory until it gets popped  

The most inner function get called (popped) first and makes it was outward. Stack data structure.  

Need a **base case** to stop a recursion. 

## 3 Rules 
1. Identify the base case
2. Identify the recursive case
3. Get closer and closer and return when needed. Usually you have 2 returns
